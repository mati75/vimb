# Vimb - the Vim-like browser

Vimb is a Vim-like web browser that is inspired by Pentadactyl and Vimprobable.
The goal of Vimb is to build a completely keyboard-driven, efficient and
pleasurable browsing-experience with low memory and CPU usage that is
intuitive to use for Vim users.

More information and some screenshots of Vimb browser in action can be found on

## Install

Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup.

Edit `src/config.h` to match your personal preferences.

The default `Makefile` will not overwrite your customised `config.h` with the
contents of `config.def.h`, even if it was updated in the latest git pull.
Therefore, you should always compare your customised `config.h` with
`config.def.h` and make sure you include any changes to the latter in your
`config.h`.

Run the following commands to compile and install Vimb (if necessary, the last one as
root).

    make clean
    make // or make GTK=3 to compile against gtk3
    make install

To build Vimb against GTK3 you can use `make GTK=3`.
